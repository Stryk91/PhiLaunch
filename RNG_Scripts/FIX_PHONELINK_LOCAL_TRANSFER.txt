  FORCE LOCAL TRANSFER - STOP CLOUD ROUTING
========================================

YOUR PROBLEM:
=============
Phone Link is routing your 50GB file through Microsoft's cloud
servers instead of using your direct 10Gbps USB connection!

This is Microsoft's stupid design - it defaults to cloud relay
when it can't establish direct P2P connection.


IMMEDIATE FIX - USE NEARBY SHARE INSTEAD:
==========================================

METHOD 1: Windows Nearby Share (Built-in, FAST)
------------------------------------------------

ON YOUR PC:
1. Press Windows + A (Action Center)
2. Click "Nearby Sharing" to turn it ON
3. Click the arrow on "Nearby Sharing"
4. Select "Everyone nearby"

ON YOUR SAMSUNG PHONE:
1. Swipe down from top (Quick Settings)
2. Find "Nearby Share" or "Quick Share"
3. Turn it ON
4. Set to "Contacts only" or "Everyone"

TO SEND FILE:
1. On PC: Right-click the file
2. Select "Share"
3. Choose your Samsung phone from the list
4. Accept on phone

SPEED: Should hit 500+ MB/s (10Gbps USB connection)
TIME: 50GB in about 2 minutes!


METHOD 2: Direct File Transfer via USB (GUARANTEED FAST)
---------------------------------------------------------

ON YOUR PC:
1. Plug phone into USB (already done)
2. Phone notification: "USB for file transfer"
3. Tap notification → Select "File Transfer" mode
4. Open File Explorer on PC
5. Your phone appears as a drive
6. Drag and drop the 50GB file
7. DONE!

SPEED: Full USB 3.0/3.1 speed (200-500 MB/s)
TIME: 50GB in 2-5 minutes


METHOD 3: SMB Network Share (Local Network)
--------------------------------------------

ON YOUR PC:
1. Right-click the folder with your 50GB file
2. Properties → Sharing tab
3. Click "Share..."
4. Add "Everyone" → Set to "Read"
5. Click "Share"
6. Note the network path (e.g., \\DESKTOP-J082S5E\Users\Shared)

ON YOUR SAMSUNG PHONE:
1. Install "Solid Explorer" or "FX File Explorer" from Play Store
2. Open app → Menu → Network
3. Add "Windows Share"
4. Enter: \\192.168.50.149\Users\Shared
5. Browse and download file

SPEED: WiFi or USB tethering speed (100-500 MB/s)
TIME: 50GB in 2-10 minutes


METHOD 4: FTP Server (Technical but Fast)
------------------------------------------

ON YOUR PC:
1. Download FileZilla Server (free)
   https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=server
2. Install and run
3. Create user with access to your file folder
4. Note your PC's IP address: 192.168.50.149

ON YOUR SAMSUNG PHONE:
1. Install "FX File Explorer" from Play Store
2. Add Network → FTP
3. Host: 192.168.50.149
4. Port: 21
5. Enter username/password
6. Download file

SPEED: Full network speed (100-500 MB/s)


WHY PHONE LINK IS FAILING:
===========================

Phone Link uses cloud relay when:
- Firewall blocks direct P2P ports (47000-48000)
- Windows Defender Firewall has Phone Link restricted
- USB connection isn't recognized as "local network"
- NAT traversal fails

Microsoft designed it this way for "compatibility" but
it's fucking stupid for large files.


FIX PHONE LINK FOR FUTURE (Advanced):
======================================

1. Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
   - Run: wf.msc

2. Inbound Rules → New Rule
   - Rule Type: Port
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Specific local ports: 47000-48000
   - Allow the connection
   - Name it "Phone Link Direct Transfer"

3. Repeat for UDP ports 47000-48000

4. Restart Phone Link app

5. Try transfer again - might use local connection now


ALTERNATIVE APPS (Better than Phone Link):
===========================================

• Snapdrop.net (Browser-based, LAN only, FAST)
  - No app install needed
  - Direct P2P
  - Works on same WiFi/USB network

• LocalSend (Open source, FAST)
  - Install on PC and phone
  - Direct transfer, no cloud
  - https://localsend.org/

• KDE Connect (Best for Samsung)
  - Direct connection always
  - Never uses cloud
  - More features than Phone Link

• Syncthing (For continuous sync)
  - P2P only, never cloud
  - Great for large files


RECOMMENDED RIGHT NOW:
======================

1. CANCEL the Phone Link transfer (it's wasting time)

2. Unplug phone, replug it

3. On phone notification: Choose "File Transfer" mode

4. Open File Explorer on PC

5. Find your phone as a drive

6. Copy/paste the 50GB file directly

7. Done in 2-3 minutes instead of hours!
